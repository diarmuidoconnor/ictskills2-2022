# Developing a Movies Fan App.

In this lab we will complete the Movies Fan app.

The only remaining feature is to enable the user write their own review of a favorite movie. Also, known bugs identified in the previous lab will be fixed and we will improve the app's performance by caching server state.

The new React features used in this development iteration include:

- The Render props pattern.
- The Context API.
- 3rd party hooks, e.g. useForm.

[Note. in the previous lab you developed an Upcoming movies page as an exercise. This will be temporarily broken as a result of refactoring done in this lab. However, the exercise at the end will allow you to get it working again.]
