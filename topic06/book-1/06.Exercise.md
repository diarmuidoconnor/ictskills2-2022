# Exercises.
## Exercise 1.

The Upcoming movies page you developed in the previous lab no longer works due to the refactoring we carried out. Make the necessary adjustments to your code to get it working again.

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Fix upcoming movies page"
$ git push origin main
~~~
## Exercise 2.

Suppose we want the movies on the Upcoming movies page to have a different action icon(s), as shown:

![][buttonw]

The icon is called PlaylistAdd(see - [see here](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/) - and it should allows the user add the movie to their 'to watch' list. For now clicking the icon need not do anything; we just need this icon to render on this page's movies. Make the necessary additions to your app code to achieve this. 

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "New button for upcoming movies page"
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 3.

Currently the Upcoming movies page retrieves the list of upcoming movies itself, however, we could place this functionality in the MoviesContext. In `api/tmdb-api.js` add this function:
~~~
export const getUpcomingMovies = () => {
  return fetch(
    `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=${process.env.REACT_APP_TMDB_KEY}&language=en-US&include_adult=false&include_video=false&page=1`
  )
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then((json) => json.results);
};
~~~
Replace the entire content of `src/contexts/moviesContext.js` with the following:
~~~
import React, { useEffect, createContext, useReducer } from "react";
import { getMovies, getUpcomingMovies } from "../api/tmdb-api";

export const MoviesContext = createContext(null);

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "add-favorite":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.map((m) =>
          m.id === action.payload.movie.id ? { ...m, favorite: true } : m
        ),
        upcoming: [...state.upcoming],
      };
    case "remove-favorite":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.map((m) =>
          m.id === action.payload.movie.id ? { ...m, favorite: false } : m
        ),
        upcoming: [...state.upcoming],
      };
    case "load-discover-movies":
      return {
        movies: action.payload.movies,
        upcoming: [...state.upcoming]
      };
    case "load-upcoming":
      return { upcoming: action.payload.movies, movies: [...state.movies] };
    case "add-review":
      return {
        movies: state.movies.map((m) =>
          m.id === action.payload.movie.id
            ? { ...m, review: action.payload.review }
            : m
        ),
        upcoming: [...state.upcoming],
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { movies: [], upcoming: [] });

  const addToFavorites = (movieId) => {
    const index = state.movies.map((m) => m.id).indexOf(movieId);
    dispatch({ type: "add-favorite", payload: { movie: state.movies[index] } });
  };

  const removeFromFavorites = (movieId) => {
    const index = state.movies.map((m) => m.id).indexOf(movieId);
    dispatch({
      type: "remove-favorite",
      payload: { movie: state.movies[index] },
    });
  };
  
  const addReview = (movie, review) => {
    dispatch({ type: "add-review", payload: { movie, review } });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getMovies().then((movies) => {
      dispatch({ type: "load-discover-movies", payload: { movies } });
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    getUpcomingMovies().then((movies) => {
      dispatch({ type: "load-upcoming", payload: { movies } });
    });
    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
  }, []);

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        movies: state.movies,
        upcoming: state.upcoming,
        addToFavorites: addToFavorites,
        addReview: addReview,
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
~~~
Above we have extended the scope of the context's state to include the upcoming movies. The reducer function has an additional action - load-upcoming. For each switch case in the reducer we must return the __full state data structure__, including those parts of the state an action does not change, e.g. the add-favorite action does not change the list of upcoming movies.

__You are required__ to change your upcoming movies page component so that it now get its list of upcoming movies from the context. 

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Change upcoming movies page to use context"
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 4.

Returning to the 'Add to Watch List' icon, suppose clicking it causes the movie to be tagged as a movie to watch in the future. This should result in the PlaylistAddCheckIcon appearing in the top-left corner of the movie card:

![][placi]

[Ideally we should add a new page that lists those movies tagged 'to watch' but you can ignore this aspect.] 

Make the necessary changes to your app code to achieve this. 

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Tag movies to watch in the future"
$ git push origin main
~~~
