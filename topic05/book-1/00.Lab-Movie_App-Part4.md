# Developing a Movies Fan App.

in this lab we will complete the Movies Fan app. 

The only remaining feature is to enable the user write their own review of a favorite movie. Also, known bugs identified in the previous lab will be fixed. 

The new React features used in this development iteration include:

+ The Render props pattern.
+ The Context API.
+ 3rd party hooks, e.g. useForm.
 
## Submit Lab Work.

On completing this final lab you should submit an archive of the `moviesApp` folder for assessment.
Before creating the archive please delete the `node_modules` as this is unnecessary and it will significantly reduce the archive size. As you know, the local git repository of a project is stored in a folder called `.git` - see screenshot:

![][git]

Some archive utilities omit 'hidden' files (a file/folder whose name begins with '.`) when creating an archive. Be sure to check your lab archive for the inclusinn of the `.git` folder as it is extremely important. You will need to change the configuration of your archive utility if hidden files are omitted.

Submit your archive to Moodle on/before July 17th - see [here][moodle].
