## Building a production app.

While the app is now complete the development server environment is not suitable for a public-facing or production app. Transpilation should not be happening dynamically and all file sizes should be **minified**, thus improving load-time performance. To build a production-ready app, stop the development server and type the command:
~~~
$ npm run build
~~~
This creates a `build` folder to house the production-quality, static form of the app:

![][build]

The name of the minified file containing your React code is a computed hash value of its content, e.g. `main.3292776c.chunk.js`. This is an aid to browser caching operations.

We can use VS Code's Live Server extension to demo the production version of the app. Open a new window in VS Code:

![][window]

Drag-and-drop the project's `build` folder to the new VS Code window. In the status bar at the bottom, click 'Go Live' link to start the Live server. The browser should be rendering your app.

Notice in the project's `.gitignore` file (generated by CRA) the `/build` folder is included - we never commit generated files/folders to a repository. Performing a git commit anytime in the future will not cause the build files to be stored in the repository.
