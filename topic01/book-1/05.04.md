## Exercise 4 (Iteration).
 
In the previous exercise the component was hard-coded to expect a modules array prop of exactly two elements. It should be able to handle any __array size__. 

__You are required__ to implement your solution to this requirement in `components/exercises/04_iteration.js`. Use `components/samples/04_iteration.js` as a guide.


The story for this exercise is already implemented. In `stories/exercises.js` see:
~~~
  .add("04 - iteration", () => {
     return <CourseModulesCollections modules={modules} course={name} />;
  });
~~~
THe Storybook page renders your solution on clicking 'Exercises -> 04 - iteration'. THe rendered output should be as follows:

![][exercise4] 

An outline solution is [available here][solutions].

On completing the exercise, update the local repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 4 completed"
~~~
That completes the lab.
