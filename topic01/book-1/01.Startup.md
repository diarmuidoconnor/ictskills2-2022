## Startup.

Download and unzip [this archive][code]. Open a terminal window, go to the base folder (`basicReactLab`) and type:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~
[This installs the JS modules needed (e.g. React and its dependencies) in a local folder, called `node_modules`.]

The base folder contains the following top-level folder structure:
~~~
     basicReactLab
       |
       |---.storybook
       |---components
       |     |
       |     |---exercises
       |     |---samples
       |
       |---node_modules
       |---stories
       package.json
~~~
Your main focus will be on the two sub-folders of `components`. In the `components/samples` folder are the completed sample components covered in the lectures. The `components/exercises` folder has skeleton implementations of the components you will develop during this lab. In the terminal, from the base folder, type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
This is shorthand for:
>$ npx start-storybook -p 9001 -c .storybook

The command runs the named executable, locating in `./node_modules/.bin`. The 'start-storybook' executable transpiles all ES6 and JSX code in the project, starts the storybook web server on port 9001, opens a web browser tab and navigate to: http://localhost:9001 :

### The samples.

Each file in the `components/samples` folder contains a component implementation. The file names are prefixed with a sequence number (01_, 02_ etc) to help relate it to the text name that appear in the side panel of the Storybook UI. For example, the component definition in `components/samples/03_props.js` can be seen in Storybook at 'Samples -> 03 - component with props':

By convemtion, a component file name matches the component name exported by the file. This practice is not applied here only for convenience sake..

The Storybook server provides live-reloading - you can see the effect of code changes immediately. For example, in the browser, click the `01 - static component` sample. Open the file `components/samples/01_staticComponent.js` and change the list of languages to the following:
~~~
<ul>
<li>Erlang</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
</ul>  
~~~
On saving the change, return to the browser and notice the change is automatically reloaded,

### The exercises components.

Click on any of the exercises components in the Storybook UI side panel. Clearly they are not completed.

Leave the Storybook server running while completing this lab's exercises. If you do need to stop it type 'cntl/c'. To restart type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
